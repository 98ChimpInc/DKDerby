## Corrected Research Carousel — 8 Verified Citations

Each card in the horizontally scrolling carousel should display:

do not reorder. These have been verified against Google Scholar and Perplexity Research.

## Implementation Notes

- Card 3 is a book chapter, not a journal article. Display "Judgment Under Uncertainty —
  Cambridge University Press" in the journal field exactly as written. It will look
  slightly different from the other seven cards — that is intentional and honest.

- Card 7 (Brier 1950) is from meteorology, not psychology. This is correct and
  intentional — the Brier score originated in weather forecasting. The one-line
  summary provides the bridge to why it appears here.

- Do not add, substitute, or fabricate any additional citations beyond these eight.
  Academic credibility is the core brand asset — a single inaccurate citation
  undermines the entire value proposition.

- All author names, journal names, years, and titles must appear exactly as written
  above. Do not abbreviate, reorder authors, or modernize formatting.
